        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if
        not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

        "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make 
        a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the 
        free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks 
        was the best -  and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully 
        switched careers working as a Sofware Engineer for a VR startup.  "

        "Before joining the Bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals
        who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enrol by a former a student of theirs who
        can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. The were very
        hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took
        my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've oftern referred to it duriing interviews
        as an example of my development experience. It certainly help me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
        100% recommend! "
